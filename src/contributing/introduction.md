# What is This?
This is meant to be both a guide of how to get started contributing for SS14 and an introduction to development as a whole. The end goal is that you not only have successfully made a pull request (PR), but that you also have a decent understanding of what, why, and how you do so. 

People with any sort of development experience may find sections of this guide redundant; please keep in mind that it is written with new developers in mind. 

# What's in This Guide?
 This primarily focuses on introducing the tools you will be using to create a PR, rather than the nitty gritty of developing as a whole. Please consider looking at WizDen's [developer docs](https://docs.spacestation14.com/index.html) if you want to learn more about the finer details.
